# SAM - Your Pocket Samaritan

<p>SAM is a platform that empowers users to report local occurrences in a simple, uniform, and intuitive way. By providing local authorities with a standardized method to receive and address reports, SAM aims to bridge the gap between communities and authorities.</p>

## About the Project

<p>SAM allows users to place pinpoints on a map to report occurrences and detail them with a title, description, and category. Users browsing the map can access a side menu displaying the five closest occurrences to the map's current center. They can also click on them to get to know their title.</p>

<p>Future iterations will include the ability to upload images, enable authorities to resolve occurrences directly, and offer enhanced notification systems.</p>

<p>Here’s a glimpse of the platform:</p>
